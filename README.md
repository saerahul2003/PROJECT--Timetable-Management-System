# PROJECT--Timetable-Management-System
This C program generates timetables for two sections (A and B) of a computer engineering course. It assigns subjects and activities (labs, lunch, etc.) to time slots randomly. Functions print the timetable in different views: numeric, subject names, or faculty IDs. Data is read from files, and labs are scheduled without overlap between sections..
